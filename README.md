Six measures over one input, each answering a different question: are these two
sequences alike as a whole (`-vector`, `-d2star`, `-cosine`, `-spacing`), how much
of one occurs in the other (`-contain`), and where (`-scan`).

To run the project from the command line. Command-line options, separated by spaces. 
The executive file ```GeneDistance.jar``` is in the ```dist``` directory, which can be copied to any location. 
Go to the target folder and type the following; an individual file or a file folder can be specified:

```java -jar GeneDistance.jar <target_file_path/Folder_path>```


### Basic usage:

```java -jar <GeneDistancePath>\dist\GeneDistance.jar <target_file_path> optional_commands```

The full list of the options is printed by:

```java -jar GeneDistance.jar --help```


### Options:

The **default measure is ```-vector```** — run with no measure flag and it is used. The former
default, the k-mer spacing measure, is now ```-spacing```.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ```-kmer=N``` | set of k-mers used in the analysis: ```4```/```5```/```6```/```8```/```10``` or ```41```/```61```/```81```/```101```, default ```-kmer=4``` (see [what the numbers mean](#what-the--kmer-numbers-mean)) |
| ```-vector``` | **the default** — a method for homology between fragments of very different length. A short sequence is compared to the **best window** of a longer one at its own scale, on **either strand**, and a score counts only when it clears the **chance level measured from the input itself** for that length class. The per-window comparison of two composition profiles is equivalent to the *d2\** statistic (k-mer counts centred on the base composition); the local window, the two strands and the calibrated floor are ```-vector```'s own — none of them part of *d2\** |
| ```-spacing``` | the former default: how the k-mers are *spaced* inside each sequence |
| ```-d2star``` | compare the k-mer **frequencies** instead of their spacing, each count centred on the base composition of its own sequence (the *d2\** measure) |
| ```-cosine``` | the same, on the raw frequencies, without centring |
| ```-contain```, ```-contain=K``` | **containment**: how much of each sequence occurs in each other one, on the whole k-mer space. Finds a short element inside a long sequence. ```-contain=K``` sets the exact k in one go, as ```-ksize=K``` does |
| ```-scan```, ```-scan=N``` | **where** each sequence holds the query: a window the size of the query is walked along them. The query is the first sequence of the input, or the N-th |
| ```-ksize=K``` | the k of the exact k-mers ```-contain``` and ```-scan``` use (6-31, 11-16 suits most cases). Chosen for the length of the sequences unless given. It is unrelated to ```-kmer=```, which names one of the sets above |
| ```-scaled=N``` | **FracMinHash** for ```-contain``` / ```-scan```: keep only ~1/N of the k-mers so a 2 Gb genome fits in memory (N = 1…1000000). ```N=1``` is the default and is exact; ```-scaled``` or ```-scaled=auto``` chooses N for the size |
| ```-kmerstat``` | report the k-mer distances of each sequence, instead of comparing them |
| ```-kmer2stat``` | report the k-mer distances averaged over all the target sequences |
| ```-h```, ```--help```, ```-?```, ```/?``` | print the help and exit |
| ```--version``` | print the version and exit |

```-d2*``` is accepted for ```-d2star``` and ```-space``` for ```-spacing```. Option names are
case-insensitive and any number of leading dashes is accepted (```-vector```, ```--vector```), but
an option must carry at least one — ```kmer=N``` alone is the only exception, anything else without
a dash is taken for the input path. **An option that is not recognised is ignored without a
message**, so a misspelt measure leaves the default one running: check the ```Measure:``` line each
run prints before trusting a result.

The first argument that is not an option is the target file or folder; giving a second one is an
error. Given a folder, every file in it is read and all their sequences are pooled into **one**
analysis.

### What the ```-kmer=``` numbers mean

| Value | k-mer set | Value | k-mer set |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ```4``` (default) | symmetric and mirror 4-mers | ```41``` | non-symmetric 4-mers |
| ```5``` | symmetric 5-mers | ```61``` | non-symmetric 6-mers |
| ```6``` | symmetric 6-mers | ```81``` | non-symmetric 8-mers |
| ```8``` | symmetric 8-mers | ```101``` | non-symmetric 10-mers |
| ```10``` | symmetric 10-mers | | |

The two-digit forms are the same word lengths counted without folding a k-mer together with its
reverse complement: ```41``` is the non-symmetric 4-mer set, ```101``` the non-symmetric 10-mer one.
The set in force is printed at the start of every run. ```-kmer=``` does not apply to ```-contain```
and ```-scan```, which use exact k-mers of length ```-ksize=K```.


### Sequences of unequal length

The spacing measure — ```-spacing```, the former default — compares how the k-mers are *spaced*
inside each sequence, and a k-mer only counts once it has been seen at least twice. A short sequence
therefore arrives with an almost empty vector, and its homology to a long one goes unseen. That is
why it is no longer the default: use ```-d2star``` there, or ```-vector``` (the default) when the
lengths differ by more than a few fold. On ```test/2.txt``` (18S rRNA of macaque and man, the same
18S diluted with random DNA, and three random sequences), with ```-kmer=41```:

| pair | truth | ```-spacing``` | ```-cosine``` | ```-d2star``` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 18S macaque / 18S human | orthologs | 99 | 100 | 100 |
| 18S / the 18S-28S unit holding it | homologous | 55 | 83 | 51 |
| 18S / 18S + 2 kb of random DNA | homologous | 77 | 96 | 75 |
| 18S / random DNA | **unrelated** | **61** | **87** | **6** |
| random / random | **unrelated** | **65** | **89** | **2** |

The reports of the measures are written side by side, as ```_kN.*```, ```_kN_cos.*```,
```_kN_d2s.*```, ```_kN_vec.*```, ```_cK.*``` and ```_scanK.xls```, and never overwrite one another.

### Fragments of very different length: ```-vector```

```-d2star``` compares whole sequences, which averages a shared region away when one sequence is
much longer than the other. ```-vector``` fixes that the way TotalRepeats' *-vector* mode does: a
short sequence is compared not to a long one as a whole but to the **best window of the long one at
the short one's own scale** (step = half a window), on **either strand**, and a score is kept only
when it stands clear of the **chance level measured for that length scale** from the input's own
content (non-homologous windows screened by an exact 25-mer). On ```test/2.txt``` with ```-kmer=41```:

| pair | truth | ```-d2star``` | ```-vector``` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 18S / the 18S-28S unit holding it | 18S is inside it | 51 | **97** |
| 28S / the unit (reverse-complemented inside) | 28S is inside it | 45 | **98** |
| 18S / 18S + 8.6 kb random | homologous | 29 | 100 |
| any / random, barley, arabidopsis | **unrelated** | small | **0** |

The calibrated floor needs enough content to measure the chance level; on a small input a length
scale that cannot be calibrated is simply left uncut (its raw, already well-separated scores are
reported). For a short element that shares only part of *both* sequences (e.g. two different genomic
regions each carrying the same element plus their own flanks), ```-contain``` remains the sharper
tool — it asks "how much is shared" rather than "is the composition matched at scale".

Inside a single window, the two composition profiles are scored the way the *d2\** statistic does —
k-mer counts centred on the base composition each window would produce by chance, then compared as a
correlation (Reinert et al., *J Comput Biol*, 2009). That is the kernel only; ```-vector``` is not
*d2\**. *d2\** is a whole-sequence distance, whereas ```-vector``` wraps that kernel in the local
window, the two strands and the data-calibrated floor above — which is what lets it find partial
homology across very different lengths, where whole-sequence *d2\** cannot.

*Windowing and the per-scale chance floor follow* SequencesClustering *of* TotalRepeats.


### A short element inside a long sequence

No measure of the composition of a sequence *as a whole* - not the default one, not *d2\** - can
find a 300 bp element inside a 10 kb sequence: the element is 3% of what is being measured. That
is what ```-contain``` is for. It asks a different question, and it is asymmetric:

```
C(A,B) = |kmers(A) & kmers(B)| / |kmers(A)|      how much of A occurs in B
```

An Alu element (289 bp), and the same element planted, 5% mutated, in the middle of 10 kb of
unrelated DNA:

| | ```-d2star``` | ```-contain``` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alu / the 10 kb **holding it** | 42 | **75** |
| Alu / 10 kb of unrelated DNA | 39 | **0** |

The k-mers are canonical, so an element inserted the other way round is still found - in
```test/2.txt``` that is how the 28S turns up inside the 18S-28S unit, reverse complemented, at 98%.
The report also estimates the identity of the shared part, *p = C*<sup>1/k</sup>, and leaves it at 0
where the shared k-mers are no more than chance would give.

```-contain``` keeps the k-mers of every sequence in memory, about 8 bytes per base, so a folder of
whole genomes wants ```java -Xmx8g -jar ...``` — or a **FracMinHash sketch** to bound that.


### Chromosome-scale input (up to 2 Gb): ```-scaled```

The exact ```-contain``` / ```-scan``` hold every distinct k-mer, ~8 bytes each, so a 2 Gb genome
needs ~16 GB per sequence. ```-scaled=N``` keeps only the k-mers whose hash falls in the bottom
1/N of the hash space (a FracMinHash sketch, as in Mash / sourmash), so the set shrinks by N while
the containment estimated from the kept fraction stays unbiased. Measured on two related 50 Mb
sequences:

| | heap needed | time | containment | identity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ```-contain``` (exact) | ~2 GB | 8.6 s | 8% | 86% |
| ```-contain -scaled=1000``` | **~200 MB** | **1.0 s** | 8% | 86% |

Same numbers, a tenth of the memory and a tenth of the time. At ```-scaled=1000``` a 2 Gb genome's
sketch is ~2 M hashes (~16 MB) instead of ~16 GB. ```-scaled=1``` (the default) is the exact
measure, bit for bit; ```-scaled``` with no number picks N from the size of the input. Reports go to
```_cKsN.*``` / ```_scanKsN.*``` so a sketch run never overwrites an exact one.

### FASTA larger than 2 GB

The input is read **record by record from a stream**, not loaded whole, so a multi-FASTA past the
~2.1 GB that a single Java array can hold is read all the same. The records are byte for byte the
ones the old whole-file reader produced (verified over the test corpus and its edge cases), so every
mode's output is unchanged.

What that costs in memory depends on the mode:

| mode | held in memory | a 2 Gb genome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ```-d2star``` / ```-cosine``` | one small vector per record, streamed | **constant** — ran 2×50 Mb in a 256 MB heap |
| ```-contain -scaled=N``` | only the sketches | **~16 MB per genome** — 512 MB heap is plenty |
| ```-scan``` | the query index and one subject at a time | ~ the largest record |
| ```-vector``` (default) | a segmented ```SeqStore``` (it needs random access to windows) | ~ the data, but a record may exceed 2.1 GB |
| ```-spacing``` | one small vector per record, streamed | **constant** |

```-d2star```/```-cosine```/```-spacing``` only pass over each record once, so they stream it into a
small vector and never hold the sequences. ```-vector``` (the default) compares a short sequence to
arbitrary windows of a longer one and draws random windows to calibrate, so it needs random access; it
streams the input into a **segmented ```SeqStore```** (1 GB byte[] segments addressed by a global
```long``` offset), which holds the data once — no second copy for the reverse strand — and lets a
single chromosome exceed the 2.1 GB a String can hold. Every mode now reads the input as a stream.

Demonstrated on a 2.09 GiB, 3 × 740 Mb file: ```Files.readAllBytes``` cannot allocate an array that
large and the old reader fails with an out-of-memory error even at ```-Xmx8g```; the streaming
reader runs ```-contain -scaled=1000``` on it in a 512 MB heap in 35 s. One record may still exceed
~2.1 Gb only in the exact (unsketched) modes that hold it as a String; ```-contain```/```-scan```
with ```-scaled``` never build the String, so a single chromosome of any size is fine.


### Where the element sits

```-contain``` says how much of a sequence is there, ```-scan``` says **where**. A window the size of
the query is walked along every other sequence, base by base, and each region that holds the query
is reported with its bounds, the identity of the match, and an E-value - the number of regions this
good that an unrelated sequence of that length would be expected to yield, so that the best of a
hundred thousand windows is not mistaken for a find.

An Alu element planted, 5% mutated, at base 5000 of 10 kb of unrelated DNA:

```
> java -jar GeneDistance.jar mix.fa -scan

Query: Q_AluYb11_289 (289 bp, 279 distinct k-mers of length 11)
4 region(s) hold the query.
   M_AluYb11_5pct           1..289 (289 bp), best window at 1     containment 70%  identity 97%  E=0.0
   H_AluJo_283_real_homolog 1..274 (274 bp), best window at 1     containment 39%  identity 92%  E=0.0
   L_10kb_CONTAINS_AluYb11  5008..5288 (281 bp), best window at 5000  containment 75%  identity 97%  E=0.0
```

The element is found where it was put, and the 10 kb of unrelated DNA holds nothing (its best window
scores E = 180, which is to say chance alone would give as much 180 times over). On ```test/2.txt```
the 18S of the macaque is found at base 3641 of the 18S-28S unit, after the 5' ETS, and the 28S at
7900, reverse complemented.

The report also holds the profile - the containment of the query under the window, along each
sequence - which plots as a curve of where the query is and is not.

*E-value*: the Poisson tail of the count of shared k-mers over the windows walked, in the manner of
Altschul SF et al. (1990) *J Mol Biol* 215:403-410. The k-mers of a window overlap, so it is the
usual first approximation, not an exact probability.

### Output:

Written next to the input (```result_kN.*``` when a folder is given):

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| ```<input>_kN.xls``` | k-mer counts, k-mer distances, and the similarity matrix (%) |
| ```<input>_kN.meg``` | distance matrix for MEGA (lower-left), to build a tree |
| ```<input>_cK.xls``` | ```-contain```: containment matrix (%) and the identity (%) of the shared part |
| ```<input>_cK.meg``` | ```-contain```: distance matrix (1 - identity) for MEGA |
| ```<input>_scanK.xls``` | ```-scan```: best window per sequence, the regions that hold the query (position, identity, E-value) and the containment profile |

A ```-cosine```, ```-d2star``` or ```-vector``` run writes ```_kN_cos.*```, ```_kN_d2s.*``` or
```_kN_vec.*```; a sketched ```-contain``` / ```-scan``` writes ```_cKsN.*``` / ```_scanKsN.*```. No
report ever overwrites the report of another measure.

Exit codes: 0 = done, 1 = wrong usage or no sequence found, 2 = I/O error or out of memory.
